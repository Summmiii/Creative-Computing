    <div id="title">NYC Artbook Fair</div>

    <div id="paragraph">The NYC Art Book Fair has lots of interesting art book, which reminds me of a saying “prints bring art to life”. Usually people design graphics and typographic and view them on screen. Prints have a different feeling from digital screen because they are tactile and interactive. The combination of images and type is the reason why these books are so well-designed and eye-catchy. I have talked to many designers there at the art book fair. While they talk about the stories behind the books and the thinkings they have put into the book, I could feel the great passion they have toward making prints and spreading their ideologies through this media.<br>

            <br>I am attractive by Kurt Johannessen’s “Exercise” series. The designer published 4 books for the collection, including: Exercise, Other Exercise, Other Other Exercise, and Other Other Other Exercise. These 4 books have caught my eyes firstly because of their outlooks: the books are made as small white squares with titles centered on the cover page. This design reminds me of Minimalism. Because of their visually appealing outlook, I start to read the titles and realize that the titles are connected. After opening the book, the inner design is just as the same style as the covers, which creates a sense of consistency. As a reader, it’s very comfortable reading books like this.<br>
            
            <br>The quotes written inside the books are easy, relaxing but worth thinking over and over again. For example: “Eat a thousand seeds, and drink a glass of water. Go outside and lie down in the sun.”; “Buy a book with blank. Go home and read it.” Each page conveys an interesting quote that makes you laugh or, maybe feel confused, at the beginning but soon you would realize the designer is actually communicating some kind of ideology to you. Personally, I feel like the book is telling me to slow down and relax; to give myself some bit of time and space; to look around the world; and to discover beauty and little surprises in everyday life.
