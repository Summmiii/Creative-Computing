    <div id="title">Every Day I Pray For Love</div>

    <div id="paragraph">Yayoi Kusama, one of my favorite Japanese artist has opened her exhibition, named Every Day I Pray For Love, at NYC. As usual, Kusama shows the public her colorful works including 3D sculptures and 2D paintings and her signature infinity room. She has also introduced a new, liquid-like installation work, which is made of steel elements.<br> 

            <br>She titles her mirrored infinity room “Dancing Lights That Flew Up To The Universe”. It takes hours to get into the space but it’s worth the waiting. After stepping into the space, a great sense of infinity and universe penetrates into my eyes through the lights. The LED light balls switch colors between red and white. To me, it’s like fantasy and reality in a way. The longer I stay in the room, the stronger a sense of obsession I could feel. I start to think about lots of things including life, relationships, reality, persona and so on. It’s also impressive that I find some of my memory pieces has jumped out and flashed quickly in front of my eyes.<br> 
            
            <br>The stay is less than a minute because there is a super long line. However, I feel plenty of things and emotions in that less-than-a-minute time.<br> 
            
            <br>The other pieces are also amazing and representative. Kusama’s paintings are abstract and colorful, as well as her installation. As a designer or artist, I love and admire her obsessive and abstract art style because she is able to coney the message she wants to communicate to viewers. As a viewer, most importantly, I love the fact that her works are able to interact with me and could stimulate my thinkings toward broad issues like life and person.
