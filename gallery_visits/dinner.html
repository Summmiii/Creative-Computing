    <div id="title">The Dinner Party</div>

    <div id="paragraph">The Dinner Party is Judy Chicago’s iconic work of feminist art, intending to represent 1,038 women in history. It depicts a spectacular ceremonial banquet with detail designs —a total of thirty-nine plate settings are arranged and distributed evenly on a triangular table with delicate decorations and tablewares aside. The use of textile underneath the delicates further illustrates the sense of ceremony. It’s hard to not be shocked by this impressive setting as well as its use of materiality.<br>

            <br>The settings are worth mentioning in more detail. The textiles are well-embroidered by many female weavers; the gold chalices and utensils and china-painted porcelain plates contain so many delicate details in both construction and pattern that you’re ashamed to touch with your hands. Each plate are carefully designed based on vulvar and butterfly structures that fit appropriately to the individual women being honored here. The plates are like unique representatives of personalities. Apart from the thirty-nine names on the table, the other 999 women’s names are inscribed in gold color on the white title floor below the triangular table.<br>
            
            <br>All these details in stories and names make the entire installation piece more realistic. As a viewer, I feel connected with the pieces and the personalities behind each plate.<br>
            
            <br>After observing each plate separately, I start to view the installation as a whole. The triangular shape utilizes the space well by creating a sense of symmetry. The dim light setting is intentional for creating a mysterious sense and for viewers to better focus on the plates. The entire atmosphere fits the ceremonial banquet setting well.  </div>
