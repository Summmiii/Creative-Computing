    <div id="title">Curiosity Cloud</div>

    <div id="paragraph">Curiosity Cloud is one of the most impressive works for me because of its interaction with audiences and meaningful contexts. Each bulb contains a hand fabricated replica of a different insect. Some species are common in nature, others are either endangered or extinct. When audiences walk through the installation, the insects inside bulbs are activated and they flutter within bulbs, colliding with glass and hence creating a crispy sound. The aim of this work is to present the endangered insect species. As well as creating an interactive experience for audiences.<br>

            <br>The trip to Cooper Hewitt was impressive: seeing so many interesting and visually shocking 3D pieces and understanding the concepts behind the works. These works contain a wide range of conservative concepts, for instance, the connection between geography and geology; a variety of insect species, conservation; as well as landscapes. This specific piece opens my eyes to a wider range of materials: textiles, glass, sand, video, etc. I soon realize that different materials could be used to achieve the same concept. A good choice of “Materiality” should be both visually appealing and functionally practical. It also stimulates my thinking about interaction in a way that website developers/codes could use to offer a better user experience.<br>
            
            <br>Conservation and sustainability are the two biggest points of this exhibition. As future artists and designers, we should consider conservation and sustainability in the long term, knowing how to select the best materials to better present the concepts. Conservation is not only about the abstract ideas about also about the selection of materials and interactive experiences ------if something we have created is not appreciated or not user-friendly, then it loses its function, no matter how “beautiful” it is.</div>
